Exercise 1.1
An application that I think is both interesting and tractable: 
    a movie recomendation app. MOvies are suggested based on any region of choice, favorite genre and previously liked/watched videos. 
    SIimilar to how youtube recommnds videos to watch and how tiktok displays shorts you might like.

A wacky application that would really be sweet, but is probably impossible to build: an app or quantum software that predicts lottery numbers

a. Weâ€™ve used ReactNative context to store app state. Name one other alternative and explain whether it would be better to stay with context or to switch. Zustand is a lightweight state management library for React and React Native. It uses hooks and a centralized store, but avoids the boilerplate of Redux and the prop-drilling limitations of Context. Since the app is simple we can stick with context but if we are using a global, or complex state then zustand would be better
b. When does the app actually load the item data? What ReactNative hook is used for this?

c. How effectively did Copilot work for you on this assignment? Include examples of things that it did correctly and/or incorrectly.
copilot was terrible in making app.tsx work. I couldn't stop laughing. chatgpt made app.tsx work and linked it to itemcontext.tsx delete function
